We generate a change log for our product every month. For this, we use completed pull requests for the month. We then group pull requests into four categories: (1) customer facing features: now available, (2) customer facing features: not yet released, (3) bug fixes and maintenance, and (4) internal improvements. Our change log then includes (1) customer facing features that are available.

I'm including (a) our pull requests for May in json format to this prompt. In this prompt, you're going to find (i) each completed pull request that has a pr number, title, description, and an auto generated ellipsis summary.

We used these pull requests to create the attached markdown-like file (b) 2025-05.mdx. This markdown file contains groups customer facing features into our cloud services such as Managed PostgreSQL, GitHub Runners, Ubicloud Kubernetes, AI & GPUs, Compute, and other major services. For each cloud service, the mdx file contains a list pf pull requests. These PrList ids correspond to the pr identifiers in (a)(i) pr number. For example, the Managed PostgreSQL has an id 3170 in 2025-05.mdx. This 3170 corresponds to the "pr" : 3170 in may-pull-requests.json.

Again, we start with may-pull-requests.json, group each pull request into four categories, take mostly customer facing improvements, group those pull requests into our cloud services, and then create a change log in mdx format that we provide to our customers.

If I wanted to automate this process through an LLM, what type of a prompt should I generate to feed into the LLM? I'd like the LLM then to take input as pull-requests.json and produce an mdx file for the month that's our change log.
