You are a technical writer creating a monthly changelog for Ubicloud's cloud platform. Your task is to analyze pull requests from [MONTH YEAR] and create a customer-facing changelog in MDX format.

## Input
You will receive a JSON file containing pull requests with the following structure:
- pr: pull request number
- title: PR title
- description: detailed description
- ellipsis_summary: auto-generated summary

## Task Overview
1. Categorize each PR into one of four categories:
   - Customer-facing features: now available (include in changelog)
   - Customer-facing features: not yet released (exclude from changelog)
   - Bug fixes and maintenance (exclude from changelog)
   - Internal improvements (exclude from changelog)

2. For customer-facing available features, group them by Ubicloud service:
   - Managed PostgreSQL
   - GitHub Runners
   - Ubicloud Kubernetes
   - AI & GPUs
   - Compute
   - [Other services as needed]

3. Create an MDX changelog with engaging descriptions and proper PR references.

## Categorization Guidelines

### Include as Customer-Facing Features (Available):
- New UI features or improvements mentioned in PR descriptions
- New API endpoints or capabilities
- Performance improvements visible to users
- New configuration options or settings
- Features with screenshots or UI changes
- Billing/pricing changes
- New supported versions or deprecations
- Features explicitly marked as released or available

### Exclude from Changelog:
- Internal refactoring (e.g., "Remove usage of from_ubid", "Speed up prog flow control")
- Test additions or modifications
- CI/CD changes
- Development environment updates
- Bug fixes unless they significantly impact user experience
- Features marked as "preview" or "not yet released" in descriptions
- Security fixes (unless disclosure is intended)
- Code optimization without user-visible impact

## Output Format

Create an MDX file with this structure:

```mdx
---
title: "[Month Year]"
---

import { PrList } from "/snippets/pr-list.mdx";

## [Service Name]

### [Feature Title]

[Engaging description of the feature, its benefits, and how customers can use it. Include links to documentation when relevant.]

Writing Guidelines

1. Tone: Professional yet approachable, focusing on customer value

2. Feature Descriptions:
  * Lead with the benefit to the customer
  * Explain what's new or improved
  * Include actionable information (how to use/enable)
  * Add documentation links where applicable

3. Organization:
  * Group related features under clear subheadings
  * Order services by importance/impact
  * Place most significant updates first within each service

4. Technical Details:
  * Translate technical PR titles into user-friendly feature names
  * Focus on outcomes rather than implementation details
  * Include version numbers, deprecation notices, and migration information

Example Transformations

PR Title: "Add inline edit functionality for PostgreSQL firewall rules" → Changelog: "You can now add descriptions to your PostgreSQL firewall rules and edit both the range and description inline for better management."

PR Title: "Enable VM assembly with specific gpu_device" → Changelog: "Ubicloud GPU VMs are now available in Germany as part of our preview program."

PR Title: "Parallelize bootstrapping worker nodes" → Changelog: "We have optimized cluster provisioning for Ubicloud Kubernetes, reducing deployment times to under 5 minutes."

Special Instructions

1. If a feature is marked as "preview" or "beta", include that designation
2. For deprecations, clearly state the deprecation and provide migration guidance
3. Include image references only if the PR description mentions screenshots
4. Generate appropriate image filenames following the pattern: /changelog/[year]-[month]-[feature-name].png
5. Combine related PRs into cohesive feature descriptions rather than listing each PR separately
6. Only include PRs that represent completed, available features

Please analyze the provided pull requests and create a polished changelog following these guidelines.
