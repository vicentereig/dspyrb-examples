    "description": "Previously, if a VM failed during Vm::Nexus#prep, it would continually be stuck in that step, because #prep treated Failed the same as NotStarted, and the steps to initially start prep are not the same as the steps to recover from failure.  I'm not sure what the steps are to recover from failure (since there are many different things that could fail), so this takes the hammer approach.  It sets a recreate semaphore and hops to destroy.\r\n\r\nWhen destroy (#destroy_slice) is called, if the recreate semaphore is set, after destroying the VM, it assembles a new VM with the same ubid, and then hops to start instead of exiting.\r\n\r\nTo prevent infinite recreation, there is a hard coded limit of 3 attempts. After 3 failed attempts, the Strand is moved to prep_failed state, where it stays until manual intervention. This generates a page to ensure it isn't missed.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, I added the following keyword arguments to Vm::Nexus#assemble:\r\n\r\n* ubid: ubid to set on the created Vm\r\n* vm_size: a VmSize object, which can be used directly instead of determining it from the size and arch arguments\r\n* attempt: The number of attempts made to create the VM, defaults to 1\r\n* strand: Updates existing strand instead of creating a new strand\r\n\r\nTo hold more state, it adds some additional data to the strand's stack, so that the destroy_slice method can pass it back to assemble.\r\n\r\nOther minor changes:\r\n\r\n* Add Vm#vm_size. Extracted from Vm#display_size, this is used to set the vm_size argument to assemble.\r\n\r\n* Do not show \"deleting\" as the display state for a Vm with recreate set, as showing that would look weird to the user.\r\n\r\n* If requesting to create a Vm with a specific Nic (passing nic_id to assemble), when destroying and recreate is set, the related Nic is not destroyed when the Vm is destroyed, as it will be used for the newly created Vm.  I'm not sure this is used outside the tests, so it may be overkill.\r\n\r\n* Remove transaction around Vm::Nexus#final_clean_up.

    "title": "Use vcpus for VM allocation and topology",
    "description": "This patch switches the VM allocation from Cores to VCpus when selecting a host. There are two use cases motivating this change:\r\n- we have x64 hosts that have threads_per_cores ratio of 1 (GEX44). That breaks the assumption encoded in the VmSizes, per architecture type\r\n- we are going to introduce Burstable family, where relation between number of CPUs allocated for a VM and number of Cores allocated to a slice hosting that VM may vary per VM instance, regardless of the architecture.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the number of cores is computed during the allocation, based on the actual architecture of the candidate host and then updated back to the VM. In case when the VM is allocated in a slice, the number of cores is left as 0 on the VM, and instead, the number of cores is saved in the VmHostSlice, and that is subtracted from the host. At any point in time this should be true: `vm_host.used_cores == SUM(vm_host_slice.cores) + SUM(vm.cores if vm.vm_host_slice_id.nil?)`\r\n\r\nThis logic also helps us indicate who is really controlling the cores - it is either the VmHostSlice or a Vm running without the slice. Vms inside the slice, do not control the cores and relay on the slice instead.\r\n\r\nThe special case for vcpus==1 in `cloud_hypervisor_cpu_topology` is needed for Burstables, where we will have Burstable-1 size. I wanted to include this in the review together with this patch for completeness.\r\n\r\nThere is also a separate commit now to Losen the restrictions on slice allocation. We allow now projects with `use_slice_for_allocation` flag enabled to create Standard VMs on all hosts. When the host is marked with `accept_slices`, the allocation will create a VM inside a slice. When `accepts_slices` is off, the VM creation will use the earlier allocation logic.",

Multiple VM instances can be placed inside that slice, up to the 200% CPU capacity. It could be 2 burstable-2s or 4 burstable-1s, or a combination. VMs from multiple customers can share a slice.

    "description": "Remove the version selection from k8s creation form\r\n\r\n    Since we are a new service, let's not deal with allowing an older\r\n    version of k8s on the form. If someone asks for it, we can create\r\n    v1.31 on the backend anyway. Otherwise, everything is v1.32.\r\n\r\n    This is a leftover item that fell through the cracks during the\r\n    lengthy review process.\r\n\r\n    We expect v1.33 to be released in a short while and will bring this\r\n    back again.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemove Subnet Selection From k8s Creation Form\r\n\r\n    With this patch, we remove the Subnet Selection from Kubernetes\r\n    creation form. Instead, we create a default subnet with a larger\r\n    ipv4 prefix (/16 instead of /26) with the name \"cluster-k8s-subnet\".\r\n\r\n    This way, the flow is simplified, as we don't require a customer to create\r\n    a subnet before creating a cluster. Also, the subnet would need to have\r\n    a larger prefix and changing that is not easy at the moment.\r\n    \r\nFix private subnet selection in a way to support larger subnets (/16)\r\n\r\n    Previously, random_private_ipv4 function could randomly error out\r\n    when requesting larger subnets, because one of the classes were not\r\n    large enough to accomodate /16 and the code didn't handle this case.\r\n\r\n    Now we retry the function if the initially selected family of large subnet\r\n    cannot accomodate the requested cidr size.\r\n\r\n    This is needed when we request bigger subnets for kubernetes clusters.",

These classes store their UIDs as <code>Net::IMAP::SequenceSet</code> objects (<em>not</em> expanded into arrays of integers).  Code that does not handle <code>APPENDUID</code> or <code>COPYUID</code> responses should not see any difference.  Code that does handle these responses <em>may</em> need to be updated.</p>\n<p>For v0.3.8, this option is not available\nFor v0.4.19, the default value is <code>true</code>.\nFor v0.5.6, the default value is <code>:up_to_max_size</code>.\nFor v0.6.0, the only allowed value will be <code>false</code>  <em>(<code>UIDPlusData</code> will be removed from v0.6)</em>.</p>\n<h4>Mitigate with backward compatible API</h4>\n<p>Adjust <code>config.parser_max_deprecated_uidplus_data_size</code> to limit the maximum <code>UIDPlusData</code> UID set size.\nWhen <code>config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data == true</code>, larger sets will crash.\nWhen  <code>config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data == :up_to_max_size</code>, larger sets will use <code>AppendUIDData</code> or <code>CopyUIDData</code>.</p>\n<p>For v0.3,8, this limit is <em>hard-coded</em> to 10,000.\nFor v0.4.19, this limit defaults to 1000.\nFor v0.5.6, this limit defaults to 100.\nFor v0.6.0, the only allowed value will be <code>0</code>  <em>(<code>UIDPlusData</code> will be removed from v0.6)</em>.</p>\n<h4>Please Note: unhandled responses</h4>\n<p>If the client does not add response handlers to prune unhandled responses, a malicious server can still eventually exhaust all client memory, by repeatedly sending malicious responses.  However, <code>net-imap</code> has always retained unhandled responses, and it has always been necessary for long-lived connections to prune these responses.  This is not significantly different from connecting to a trusted server with a long-lived connection.  To limit the maximum number of retained responses, a simple handler might look something like the following:</p>\n<pre lang=\"ruby\"><code>limit = 1000\nimap.add_response_handler do |resp|\n  next unless resp.respond_to?(:name) &amp;&amp; resp.respond_to?(:data)\n  name = resp.name\n  code = resp.data.code&amp;.name if resp.data.is_a?(Net::IMAP::ResponseText)\n  imap.responses(name) { _1.slice!(0...-limit) }\n  imap.responses(code) { _1.slice!(0...-limit) }\nend\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>🔧 Ensure ResponseParser config is mutable and non-global by <a href=\"https://github.com/nevans\"><code>@​nevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/381\">ruby/net-imap#381</a></li>\n<li>✨ Add SequenceSet methods for querying about duplicates by <a href=\"https://github.com/nevans\"><code>@​nevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/384\">ruby/net-imap#384</a></li>\n<li>✨ Add <code>SequenceSet#each_ordered_number</code> by <a href=\"https://github.com/nevans\"><code>@​nevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/386\">ruby/net-imap#386</a></li>\n<li>✨ Add <code>SequenceSet#find_ordered_index</code> by <a href=\"https://github.com/nevans\"><code>@​nevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/396\">ruby/net-imap#396</a></li>\n<li>✨ Add <code>SequenceSet#ordered_at</code> by <a href=\"https://github.com/nevans\"><code>@​nevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/397\">ruby/net-imap#397</a></li>\n<li>✨ Add AppendUIDData and CopyUIDData classes by <a href=\"https://github.com/nevans\"><code>@​nevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/400\">ruby/net-imap#400</a></li>\n<li>🔧 Add parser config for <code>APPENDUID</code>/<code>COPYUID</code>, 🗑️ Deprecate UIDPlusData by <a href=\"https://github.com/nevans\"><code>@​nevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/401\">ruby/net-imap#401</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>🐛 Fix <code>SequenceSet#append</code> when its <code>@string</code> is nil by <a href=\"https://github.com/nevans\"><code>@​nevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/376\">ruby/net-imap#376</a></li>\n<li>🐛 Fix SequenceSet merging in another SequenceSet by <a href=\"https://github.com/nevans\"><code>@​nevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/377\">ruby/net-imap#377</a></li>\n<li>🐛 Fix SequenceSet count dups with multiple &quot;*&quot; by <a href=\"https://github.com/nevans\"><code>@​nevans</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/387\">ruby/net-imap#387</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

One benefit\n  of that is that logs are written to and managed by journald, instead of writing\n  them into a separate log file.\n  \n\n- **Migration: Add limits to inference endpoints table**\n  Add three columns to inference_endpoints:\n  \n  * max_requests\n  to limit the number of concurrently runnings requests\n  \n  * max_project_rps\n  to define how many requests per second we allow a project to make\n  \n  * max_project_tps\n  to define how many tokens per second we allow a project to consume\n  \n\n- **Create inference endpoints with limits**\n  Inference endpoints are created with three limits:\n  \n  * max_requests\n  to limit the number of concurrently runnings requests\n  \n  * max_project_rps\n  to define how many requests per second we allow a project to make\n  \n  * max_project_tps\n  to define how many tokens per second we allow a project to consume\n  \n\n- **Set request/token quotas per inference endpoint**\n  In a previous commit we added max_project_rps and max_project_tps to\n  inference endpoints. In this commit we start sending these request/token\n  per second limits to the inference gateway, which is responsible to\n  enforce them.\n  \n\n- **Set max_concurrency of inference gateway**\n  In a previous commit we added max_concurrency to inference endpoints. In\n  this commit we set inference gateway's corresponding setting\n  IG_MAX_REQUESTS to that value during replica setup.\n  \n\n- **Enable vLLM V1 for llama-3-2-3b-it**\n  Set VLLM_USE_V1 environment variable to enable vLLM V1:\n  https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/01/27/v1-alpha-release.html\n  \n  V1 has prefix caching enabled by default.\n  \n\n- **Update AI base image to 20250210.1.0**\n  Job producing the image:\n  https://github.com/ubicloud/ai-images/actions/runs/13250750283\n  \n  The image contains\n  - Python 3.12\n  - vLLM: 0.7.2\n  - inference gateway: 0.1.6",

    "title": "Fixing issues in allocator when using slices",
    "description": "**Separating slice and no-slice VMs on hosts**\r\nThe allocator decided if the VM should be created with a slice or without a slice based on the host's accept_slices flag. However that logic only applied when the project had `use_slices_for_allocation` flag set to `true` When the project flag was false any host could be picked, and a VM with no slice was created. The result was a mix of VMs in-slices and VMs with no-slices on the same host, if the host had `accept_slices=true` flag. On hosts with `accept_slices=false` no slices were created.\r\n\r\nThis fix adds an extra constraint to not allow placement of no-slice VMs on hosts set with `accept_slices=true` from projects that do not want slices. It also sets a preference to pick a host that accepts slices for projects that do want that.\r\n\r\nTests added to cover all those cases explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Fix for GEX44 memory computation**\r\nPrevious commit introduced a couple of problems in this area, for GEX44 hosts:\r\n    - the amount of memory calculated for a VM/slice was based on number of cores and assumed 2:1 ratio of cpus to cores for stanard-gpu VM. It should be 1:1 ratio\r\n    - the memory allocated was computed in the allocator but the memory freed was taken from VmSize structure, resulting in different values on GEX44 hosts.\r\n    \r\nThis commit fixes those problems.\r\n    - It computes the amount of memory based on vcpus, just like VmSize\r\n    - The update to the host is based on request.memory_gib value when not creating a slice\r\n    - The update to the host is based on the amount allocated for a slice when using slices\r\n    \r\nAdded multiple tests to cover all those cases. Also reverted temporary fixes that Ben did to mitigate this issue.",

notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/releases\">react's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>19.0.0 (December 5, 2024)</h2>\n<p>Below is a list of all new features, APIs, deprecations, and breaking changes. Read <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19\">React 19 release post</a> and <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">React 19 upgrade guide</a> for more information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: To help make the upgrade to React 19 easier, we’ve published a react@18.3 release that is identical to 18.2 but adds warnings for deprecated APIs and other changes that are needed for React 19. We recommend upgrading to React 18.3.1 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>\n<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form <code>action</code> prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.</li>\n<li><code>useOptimistic</code>: is a new hook to update state while a Transition is in progress. It returns the state, and a set function that can be called inside a transition to “optimistically” update the state to expected final value immediately while the Transition completes in the background. When the transition finishes, the state is updated to the new value.</li>\n<li><code>use</code>: is a new API that allows reading resources in render. In React 19, <code>use</code> accepts a promise or Context. If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>\n<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Client</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>. When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. The form can be reset manually with the new <code>requestFormReset</code> API.</li>\n<li><code>&lt;button&gt; and &lt;input&gt; formAction</code> prop: Actions can be passed to the <code>formAction</code> prop to configure form submission behavior. This allows using different Actions depending on the input.</li>\n<li><code>useFormStatus</code>: is a new hook that provides the status of the parent <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code>, as if the form was a Context provider. The hook returns the values: <code>pending</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>.</li>\n<li>Support for Document Metadata: We’ve added support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively. React will automatically hoist them into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document.</li>\n<li>Support for Stylesheets: React 19 will ensure stylesheets are inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.</li>\n<li>Support for async scripts: Async scripts can be rendered anywhere in the component tree and React will handle ordering and deduplication.</li>\n<li>Support for preloading resources: React 19 ships with <code>preinit</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetchDNS</code>, and <code>preconnect</code> APIs to optimize initial page loads by moving discovery of additional resources like fonts out of stylesheet loading. They can also be used to prefetch resources used by an anticipated navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Server</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>prerender</code> and <code>prerenderToNodeStream</code> APIs for static site generation. They are designed to work with streaming environments like Node.js Streams and Web Streams. Unlike <code>renderToString</code>, they wait for data to load for HTML generation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React Server Components</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components\">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>\n<li><code>react-test-renderer</code>: In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning and has switched to concurrent rendering for web usage. We recommend migrating your tests to  <a href=\"https://github.com/testinglibrary\"><code>@​testinglibrary</code></a>.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) or <a href=\"https://github.com/testingesting-library\"><code>@​testingesting-library</code></a>.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs. We recommend first upgrading to <code>18.3.1</code>, where we've added additional deprecation warnings. Check out the <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">upgrade guide</a> for more details and guidance on codemodding.</p>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New JSX Transform is now required: We introduced <a href=\"https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html\">a new JSX transform</a> in 2020 to improve bundle size and use JSX without importing React. In React 19, we’re adding additional improvements like using ref as a prop and JSX speed improvements that require the new transform.</li>\n<li>Errors in render are not re-thrown: Errors that are not caught by an Error Boundary are now reported to window.reportError. Errors that are caught by an Error Boundary are reported to console.error. We’ve introduced <code>onUncaughtError</code> and <code>onCaughtError</code> methods to <code>createRoot</code> and <code>hydrateRoot</code> to customize this error handling.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>propTypes</code>: Using <code>propTypes</code> will now be silently ignored. If required, we recommend migrating to TypeScript or another type-checking solution.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>defaultProps</code> for functions: ES6 default parameters can be used in place. Class components continue to support <code>defaultProps</code> since there is no ES6 alternative.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>contextTypes</code> and <code>getChildContext</code>: Legacy Context for class components has been removed in favor of the <code>contextType</code> API.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Read <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19\">React 19 release post</a> and <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">React 19 upgrade guide</a> for more information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: To help make the upgrade to React 19 easier, we’ve published a react@18.3 release that is identical to 18.2 but adds warnings for deprecated APIs and other changes that are needed for React 19. We recommend upgrading to React 18.3.1 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>\n<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form <code>action</code> prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.</li>\n<li><code>useOptimistic</code>: is a new hook to update state while a Transition is in progress. It returns the state, and a set function that can be called inside a transition to “optimistically” update the state to expected final value immediately while the Transition completes in the background. When the transition finishes, the state is updated to the new value.</li>\n<li><code>use</code>: is a new API that allows reading resources in render. In React 19, <code>use</code> accepts a promise or Context. If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>\n<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Client</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>. When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. The form can be reset manually with the new <code>requestFormReset</code> API.</li>\n<li><code>&lt;button&gt; and &lt;input&gt; formAction</code> prop: Actions can be passed to the <code>formAction</code> prop to configure form submission behavior. This allows using different Actions depending on the input.</li>\n<li><code>useFormStatus</code>: is a new hook that provides the status of the parent <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code>, as if the form was a Context provider. The hook returns the values: <code>pending</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>.</li>\n<li>Support for Document Metadata: We’ve added support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively. React will automatically hoist them into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document.</li>\n<li>Support for Stylesheets: React 19 will ensure stylesheets are inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.</li>\n<li>Support for async scripts: Async scripts can be rendered anywhere in the component tree and React will handle ordering and deduplication.</li>\n<li>Support for preloading resources: React 19 ships with <code>preinit</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetchDNS</code>, and <code>preconnect</code> APIs to optimize initial page loads by moving discovery of additional resources like fonts out of stylesheet loading. They can also be used to prefetch resources used by an anticipated navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Server</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>prerender</code> and <code>prerenderToNodeStream</code> APIs for static site generation. They are designed to work with streaming environments like Node.js Streams and Web Streams. Unlike <code>renderToString</code>, they wait for data to load for HTML generation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React Server Components</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components\">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>\n<li><code>react-test-renderer</code>: In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning and has switched to concurrent rendering for web usage. We recommend migrating your tests to  <a href=\"https://github.com/testinglibrary\"><code>@​testinglibrary</code></a>.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) or <a href=\"https://github.com/testingesting-library\"><code>@​testingesting-library</code></a>.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs. We recommend first upgrading to <code>18.3.1</code>, where we've added additional deprecation warnings. Check out the <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">upgrade guide</a> for more details and guidance on codemodding.</p>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New JSX Transform is now required: We introduced <a href=\"https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html\">a new JSX transform</a> in 2020 to improve bundle size and use JSX without importing React. In React 19, we’re adding additional improvements like using ref as a prop and JSX speed improvements that require the new transform.</li>\n<li>Errors in render are not re-thrown: Errors that are not caught by an Error Boundary are now reported to window.reportError. Errors that are caught by an Error Boundary are reported to console.error. We’ve introduced <code>onUncaughtError</code> and <code>onCaughtError</code> methods to <code>createRoot</code> and <code>hydrateRoot</code> to customize this error handling.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>propTypes</code>: Using <code>propTypes</code> will now be silently ignored. If required, we recommend migrating to TypeScript or another type-checking solution.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>defaultProps</code> for functions: ES6 default parameters can be used in place. Class components continue to support <code>defaultProps</code> since there is no ES6 alternative.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>contextTypes</code> and <code>getChildContext</code>: Legacy Context for class components has been removed in favor of the <code>contextType</code> API.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

    "description": "@byucesoy kinda an invasive one that will require some care in deployment, wanted to run it by you, and why not @shikharbhardwaj since you work together more closely, and he saw my last patch fixing that typo in 4461be0b541bacb8f6e2d92d28acb11a5813a942.\r\n\r\nAlso @jeremyevans because this should both obsolete, and be superior to forking the `timeout` program every time we do a command\r\n\r\n.\r\nTerminate SSH sessions promptly and their processes\r\n\r\nThis is done with two configuration changes: one, to use ClientAlive\r\nsettings in the SSH server to take action on connections without a\r\nresponsive client, and secondly, to use `logind` configuration to\r\nspecify that processes that belong to that session are to be\r\nterminated rather than re-parented as orphans.\r\n\r\nA downside is that running `ssh` with even a single `-v` (verbose)\r\nflag will spam annoying messages to the screen during the session.  I\r\nhave often used the lowest level of verbosity to supervise at what\r\nstage an establishing connection is hanging or slow at, now I cannot\r\nleave that flag on anymore.\r\n\r\nVerification is a bit of a pain. First, it's best to have two paths to\r\nthe test computer, e.g. allocate two VMs, where one acts as a SSH jump\r\nhost to a test VM, as well as connecting to the test VM directly from\r\nyour laptop: that way you can cut network access to the jump host and\r\nobserve the results.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it's important to know that signal propagation in SSH is\r\ndifferent if a `pty` is allocated (e.g. for interactive mode): with a\r\n`pty`, SIGHUP is propagated, and most processes will decide to exit at\r\nthat point.  Without a `pty`, there is no signal.  So, when testing\r\nthis, it is better to do something like:\r\n\r\n    ssh host sleep 3600\r\n\r\nTo start a session that is non-interactive, and waits.  By omitting\r\nthe changes in this patch, you should be able to see `sleep` hanging\r\naround after the SSH server has closed the forked SSH process because\r\nof a non-responsive client.  You can use `pstree -s` to check its\r\nparentage.\r\n\r\nFrom the session with the jump host, start such a hanging command.\r\nThen, on your other connection, drop TCP packets to the jump host's\r\naddress, by running `nft -f` on nftable rules like this, substituting\r\nthe `saddr` for the jump host address:\r\n\r\n    add table inet filter\r\n    flush table inet filter\r\n    table inet filter {\r\n      chain input {\r\n        type filter hook input priority filter; policy accept;\r\n        ip6 saddr 2a01:4f8:2b01:d85:214a::2 tcp dport 22 drop\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBy using commands like `w` and `loginctl list-sessions`, you should\r\nsee the process disappear momentarily.\r\n\r\nIf you need to re-set the test and allow the jump host to send traffic\r\nagain, use `nft -f` again with:\r\n\r\n    delete table inet filter;\r\n\r\nSync the end of rhizome bootstrapping\r\n\r\nOut of an abundance of caution, block until files and directories have\r\nbeen flushed, so an unlucky reboot that did not go through graceful\r\nflushing would leave empty or incomplete files or directories that are\r\nconnected to the sensitive process of setting up the rhizome user and\r\nsecure shell.\r\n\r\nMove openssh server configuration to BootstrapRhizome\r\n\r\nPreviously, it was prep_host, which only affected the bare metal\r\nlayer, whereas I think we would be better off with uniform\r\nconfiguration for managed services (e.g. Postgres) as well.",
