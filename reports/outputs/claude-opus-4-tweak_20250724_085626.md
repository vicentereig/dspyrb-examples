This feature enables you to keep your clusters up-to-date with the latest Kubernetes releases while maintaining high availability.\n\nThe upgrade process is designed to minimize disruption:\n- Upgrades are performed sequentially, node-by-node\n- Control plane nodes are upgraded first, followed by worker nodes\n- New nodes with the upgraded version are added before old nodes are drained and removed\n- Node pools can be upgraded independently using the `incr_upgrade` operation\n\nThis rolling upgrade approach ensures your applications remain available throughout the upgrade process.\n\n<PrList ids={[2632]} />\n\n## Platform Improvements\n\n### Enhanced Project User Management\n\nWe've improved the user experience when managing project access. If you attempt to add a user who already has access to a project, you'll now receive a clear, informative error message instead of encountering a technical error. This small but important improvement makes project administration smoother and more intuitive.\n\n<PrList ids={[3083]} />"
