This feature enables you to keep your clusters up-to-date with the latest Kubernetes releases, ensuring you have access to the newest features, security patches, and performance improvements.\n\nThe upgrade process is designed to minimize disruption to your workloads:\n- Nodes are upgraded sequentially, starting with control plane nodes\n- New nodes with the upgraded Kubernetes version are created before old nodes are removed\n- Old nodes are gracefully drained before removal to ensure workload continuity\n- Node pools can be upgraded independently, giving you full control over the upgrade timeline\n\nTo upgrade your cluster, simply select the new version from the cluster management interface. Node pools require a separate upgrade action, allowing you to test upgrades on specific pools before rolling out cluster-wide.\n\n<PrList ids={[2632]} />"
