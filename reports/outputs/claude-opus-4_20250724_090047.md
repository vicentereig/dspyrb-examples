The upgrade process intelligently handles both control plane and worker nodes, ensuring your applications remain available throughout the upgrade.\n\nThe upgrade process:\n- Upgrades nodes sequentially, starting with control plane nodes\n- Creates new nodes with the upgraded Kubernetes version\n- Gracefully drains workloads from old nodes before removal\n- Allows separate upgrades for individual node pools\n\nTo upgrade your cluster, use the new upgrade functionality in the Ubicloud console or API. Node pools can be upgraded independently, giving you full control over the upgrade timeline for different parts of your infrastructure.\n\n<PrList ids={[2632]} />"
