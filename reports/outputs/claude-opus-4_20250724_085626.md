The upgrade process handles both control plane and worker nodes sequentially, ensuring your workloads remain available throughout the upgrade. Each node is gracefully replaced with an upgraded version - the old node is drained of workloads before being removed, while a new node with the updated Kubernetes version takes its place.\n\nTo upgrade your cluster, simply use the upgrade option in the Ubicloud console or API. Node pools can be upgraded separately, giving you full control over the upgrade timeline for different parts of your infrastructure.\n\n<PrList ids={[2632]} />\n\n## Platform Improvements\n\n### Enhanced Project Member Management\n\nWe've improved the experience when managing project members. If you attempt to add a user who already has access to your project, you'll now see a clear error message instead of encountering a technical error. This makes it easier to understand and manage your team's access permissions.\n\n<PrList ids={[3083]} />"
