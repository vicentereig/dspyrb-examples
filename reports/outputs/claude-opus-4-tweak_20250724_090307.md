This feature enables you to keep your clusters up-to-date with the latest Kubernetes releases while maintaining high availability.\n\nThe upgrade process is designed to minimize disruption:\n- Upgrades are performed sequentially, node-by-node, starting with control plane nodes\n- New nodes with the upgraded Kubernetes version are created before old nodes are drained and removed\n- Node pools can be upgraded independently, giving you full control over the upgrade timeline\n\nTo upgrade your cluster, simply use the upgrade option in the Ubicloud console or API. Node pools require a separate upgrade action to begin their upgrade process.\n\n<PrList ids={[2632]} />\n\n## Platform Improvements\n\n### Enhanced Project User Management\n\nWe've improved the user experience when managing project access. If you attempt to add a user who already has access to a project, you'll now receive a clear, informative error message instead of encountering a technical error. This makes it easier to manage team permissions and avoid confusion about existing access rights.\n\n<PrList ids={[3083]} />"
