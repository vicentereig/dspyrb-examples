# DSPy.rb ADE Detection: Complete Architecture & Optimization Comparison

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive comparison demonstrates DSPy.rb's flexibility and practical value by implementing and evaluating multiple ADE (Adverse Drug Event) detection approaches. We tested architectural alternatives and optimization strategies to provide real-world insights for ML practitioners.

**Key Achievement**: Showed that a direct single-signature approach achieves comparable medical safety (100% recall) at 3x lower cost than a multi-stage pipeline, demonstrating DSPy.rb's framework flexibility for cost-effective ML solutions.

## Tested Approaches

### 1. Multi-Stage Pipeline (Baseline)
```ruby
# 3 API calls per prediction
Medical Text ‚Üí DrugExtractor ‚Üí drugs[]
            ‚Üí EffectExtractor ‚Üí effects[]  
            ‚Üí ADEClassifier(text, drugs, effects) ‚Üí has_ade
```

### 2. Direct Pipeline (Baseline) 
```ruby
# 1 API call per prediction
Medical Text ‚Üí ADEDirectClassifier ‚Üí has_ade + confidence + reasoning
```

### 3. Optimization Attempts
